ggCaller documentation
==================================
ggCaller is a bacterial gene identification, annotation and pangenome analysis tool.
ggCaller uses population-level information to enable fast, accurate pangenome analysis of large genome datasets.
ggCaller traverses de Bruijn graphs (DBGs) built by [Bifrost](https://github.com/pmelsted/bifrost),
using temporal convolutional network from [Balrog](https://github.com/salzberg-lab/Balrog) for gene filtering and [Panaroo](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo) for pangenome analysis and quality control.
